How would it be/feel if you and another person have or share the same body?

Through immersive VR we attempt to mix the senses of two people and encourage them to coordinate their biomes in order to survive.
Two users collaboratively control one shared body underwater.

The two players have to synchronize their breathing to stabilize their hosting animal. 

Together they can steer the body through the depths of the ocean.

Biofeedback is collected through sensors placed on the body of each participant, sent through arduinos to Unity and used to 

control the whale. The biofeedbacks are breathing and heartbeat.
​

Players control either left or right “side”

Sensor input (breathing) is mapped to tilt of flippers

Movement direction is calculated based on “whale model”
